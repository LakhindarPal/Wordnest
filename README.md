## My process

### Built with

- **HTML5:** Semantic markup for structure.
- **CSS3:** Styling, including CSS Custom Properties (variables) for theme management.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For DOM manipulation, API calls, and interactive features.
- **Dictionary API:** [https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/) for word data.
- Google Fonts: For custom font options.

### Continued development

In future iterations, I plan to:

- Implement a more robust error handling for network issues or API rate limits.
- Explore more advanced animations for theme transitions.
- Consider a small database to cache frequently searched words for faster retrieval.
- Add a "History" feature to view recently searched words.
- Integrate a word-of-the-day feature.

### Useful resources

- **MDN Web Docs:** Invaluable resource for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **CSS-Tricks:** Great articles on CSS custom properties and theming.
- **Dictionary API Docs:** Official documentation for the API used.
